Congratulations on getting the admit to your dream university! (Even if you didn’t, don’t worry, most students figure it out once they get there). At this point, you have arrived at the pinnacle of your journey. This is the ultimate obstacle that stands between you and your dreams. However, just like all the other challenges you have encountered thus far, this one will be a piece of cake as long as you are well-prepared.

**Biometrics is the easiest part**. Done right, you’ll be out of there in less than an hour. So let’s break it down:

## 1. Documents

You’ll only need to carry the following documents:

-   Passport
-   DS-160 Confirmation Letter
-   I-20 Document
-   SEVIS Fee Payment Receipt
-   Appointment Letter

You can carry additional documents as well, but they won’t be necessary.

Mobile, smart watch and any other electronic equipments will not be allowed inside so try to carry as few items as possible. However, they do provide locker services at the Mumbai Consulate to store your electronics and other valuables.

## 2. When to Reach

The general rule of thumb is to reach half an hour before your slot. For eg. If your slot is at 9:30 AM then they’ll take you in at 9:00 AM. But in my experience and for many others as well, you can reach almost an hour early and they’ll still take you in provided there’s no queue outside.

**Note:** Be aware that there will be another queue for passport collection, so make sure you are not standing in line with them.

## 3. The Final Process

My Biometrics was scheduled for **9:30 AM on 24th April 2023** at the **Mumbai Consulate**. I reached almost an hour earlier and was immediately taken in.

1.  At the first counter, they will cross-verify the visa appointment date along with your passport and DS-160.
2.  After the initial verification, they will hand you a token which has a number written on it. You simply have to wait in a queue till the number on the screen in front of you matched the number on the token in your hand. The screen will also display the counter which you need to go to.
3.  This is the final counter for our Biometrics. Only your passport and DS-160 will be required at this counter.
4.  The officer in the booth will ask you to state your full name and date of birth to cross-verify with the passport. **Please make sure that you mention the same name as mentioned on your passport**.
5.  He will then take your photograph & register your fingerprints.
6.  They will scan your fingerprints for all 4 left-hand fingers, all 4 right-hand fingers and finally both thumbs.
7.  Finally the officer will paste a sticker on your passport mentioning the date and time of the visa interview. **Please don’t remove that sticker in any case.**

And that’s it! The entire Biometrics process was done within 5 minutes for me and I was out of the building by 9:05 AM.

**Note:** The entire setup at the last counter will be similar to the one for your visa interview as well, with the officer behind a glass pane standing on the other side and a speaker between both of you for clear communication.

I hope this article cleared up any doubts you had about the whole procedure.
