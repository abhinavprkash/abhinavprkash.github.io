## 1. Documents Required

I am going to provide you with the entire list of documents that youâ€™ll ever require. This list has been used by lakhs of students, so itâ€™s exhaustive.

Firstly, buy any [Harmonium Folder](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=harmonic+folder&i=office-products&crid=B342WOWX8RLW&sprefix=harmonic+folder%2Coffice-products%2C254&ref=nb_sb_noss_2), itâ€™ll really help in managing the documents considering that there are a lot of them to carry and youâ€™ll need to access them quickly. After you buy the folder, follow this organisational structure. Hereâ€™s a pdf [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MkRq9yoDOKXRB3kTpNdUJxaQyhYSEqOo/view?usp=sharing) for the same:

-   **Pocket 1:** I20, DS-160 Confirmation, SEVIS Fees Receipt, Visa Appointment Letter, Original Passport
-   **Pocket 2:** All Academics Documents â€” 10th Mark sheet, 12th Mark sheet, Bachelors Mark sheets, Transcripts PDC/Degree Certificate. Original is preferred for all these documents, if not available then carry a duly attested copy.
-   **Pocket 3:** Score Reports (SAT, GRE, GMAT, TOEFL)
-   **Pocket 4:** Funding Documents (FD, Savings Bank account Statement or Passbook, PF, PPF, GPF KVP, NSC, Education loan Letter)
-   **Pocket 5:** Any Investment documents (Stocks, Mutual Funds, Any policies etc.)
-   **Pockets 6:** Income Tax Returns for past 2 years, Salary Certificate or Salary Slip for the past 6 months (If youâ€™re working then yours, else your sponsorsâ€™). In case of business, carry business proof â€” GST Registration, Visiting Card, Balance Sheet, Current Account Statement etc.
-   **Pocket 7:** In case of students that have work experience, Appointment Letter, Salary Slip and also Income Tax Papers (if paid).
-   **Pocket 8:** Letter of Recommendations, Resume, SOP
-   **Pocket 9:** Other Acceptances
-   **Pocket 10:** Certificate of Achievements

Apart From the above documents you can carry Property Valuation documents, Gold Valuation, CA Certificate Etc. But it is not mandatory

## 2. Prepare for your interview

-   Prepare for your interview by reading up on othersâ€™ F-1 visa experiences. (You can read mine [**_here_**](https://www.parthdesai.site/my-f1-visa-interview-experience))
-   Join visa interview groups on Whatsapp & Telegram.
-   Compile a list of interview questions based on the experiences of others. You can refer to my question bank [**_here_**](https://www.parthdesai.site/sample-f1-visa-interview-questions). I advise you to create your own question bank and keep adding new ones to it so that you are fully prepared for any curveballs that may come your way during the F-1 visa interview.
-   Prepare your answers well and have them reviewed by others preparing for the interview. You can ask for help in the Telegram and Whatsapp groups.
-   Once youâ€™ve finalised your answers (at least 1 week before your interview), practice them in front of the mirror whenever you find the time. Donâ€™t learn these answers verbatim as the interviewer will catch it if youâ€™ve mugged up these answers. Rather, understand the gist so that you can even prepare your answers on the spot.
-   **Keep the answers brief and precise.** Your interviewer wonâ€™t have time to listen to long paragraphs so keep your answers concise.

> Most importantly, **do not lie anywhere.** If caught, your visa will be immediately rejected.

## 3. Final Prep

-   Once you are done practising your answers, try to give at least 2â€“3 mocks. This will instil confidence in you.
-   If you canâ€™t give mock interviews, I recommend practising your answers in front of a mirror. This will allow you to observe your body language and delivery, and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you are presenting yourself confidently and professionally during the F-1 visa interview.

## 4. One Day Before Your Interview

-   Double-check all of your documents against the list mentioned above and make sure youâ€™ve followed the organisational structure as mentioned. Trust me itâ€™ll save you a lot of valuable time.
-   Review and practice your answers one last time. Make sure you donâ€™t overdo it.
-   Wear good clothes for tomorrow and prefer formal, if possible

And with that! Youâ€™re ready for tomorrow. Get a good nightâ€™s sleep and donâ€™t stress yourself out â€” youâ€™ve got this.

## 5. When to reach

Reach at least **an hour** before your slot. Thereâ€™s a possibility that theyâ€™ll take you in early as thereâ€™ll be a lot of waiting during your actual slot time.

## 6. What to carry

-   If youâ€™re carrying any electronic devices like mobile, smart watch etc., leave them with your escort (friend, parent) as they wonâ€™t be allowed inside.
-   In case you are travelling alone, they do provide locker services at the Mumbai Consulate to store your electronics and other valuables. However, this is not the same for all centres.
-   Carry a little cash on you.
-   At every point in the queue they might ask for your passport so make sure you donâ€™t misplace it anywhere.

**NOTE:** Donâ€™t concern yourself with anything you hear in the queue while waiting outside. Trust your preparation.

## 7. The Final Interview

-   Once you enter the consulate, youâ€™ll go through the security check and metal detector. (Belts are allowed)
-   Post that your passport or more precisely the sticker behind it (The one you got from your biometrics day) will be used to guide you to your line.
-   Here youâ€™ll probably wait for half an hour to an hour. Make sure you keep your mind calm.
-   Once itâ€™s time for your interview, youâ€™ll be taken inside the visa lobby.
-   Here, the first queue will be for passport and DS-160 verification.
-   After that, youâ€™ll join the next queue where they will verify your fingerprints.
-   And finally, youâ€™ll join the queue for your interview. Donâ€™t stress over which counter gets allotted to you. Just trust the process.
-   Do not, I repeat, do not stress over whatâ€™s happening in your queue or the one next to you. You might overhear questions or rejections but try to avoid them. I distracted myself with a little kid who was annoying his mom because he was bored XD.
-   Finally, nail your interview. Do not hesitate to ask the interviewer to repeat his/her question. Itâ€™s completely normal.
-   Be truthful, clear & precise when you answer. Donâ€™t drag the conversation.
-   And remember, even if your visa is rejected, you can still apply again 2 more times.

I hope that this guide has been a great resource for you while preparing for your F-1 visa interview. Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
