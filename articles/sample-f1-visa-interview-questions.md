**Q. Tell me something about yourself.**

I am a 2022 computer science graduate from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ University. I am Math and Data Science enthusiast, currently working as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. And to explore more about this world of data I am going for my master’s.

**Q. Why do you want to go to the USA?**

While working as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I realised that upskilling myself is the need of the hour.
